<h1 align="center"> model for cultural classification in archaeology </h1>

This ML model is used to distinguish between two archaeological cultures (specifically epigravettian and epiaurignacian) that are hard to classify with the conventional classification approach that relies on analysing the stone tool industry.<br>

* machine learning for classification purposes in archaeology
* practical usage of the Logistic regression model as a complement for classifying stone industry in archaeology
* geographic data 
* settlement strategies in paleolithic period 

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Classifier distinguishes between two very similar archaeological cultures in terms of material culture. The input data (attributes) includes 
geospacial data related to the archaeological sites, the output is one of the archaeological cultures. The input takes 6 different attributes, namely: distance to river, distance above river, viewshed, normalized height, terrain variability 500m, Terrain variability 1000m.

## More resources

The scientific paper which backs up the whole idea of applying the machine learning model for classification purposes in such fields as archeology is available [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1040618220303657)  

## Known issues (work in progress)

It's absolutely crucial to collect more data regarding these archaeologically hard to determine cultures in order to fully understand the potential of this quite
new approach. At this stage the amount of data is not sufficient, that's why we should take this project for the time being with a grain of salt.
